This project aims to create a two-way communication between WiSA (Aqualink) and IrrigWeb, to allow the irrigation data being automatically uploaded to IrrigWeb for irrigation record keeping, and to allow automatically scheduling on Aqualink for better irrigation management. 

This project consists of two parts: 1) Uplink, which automatically uploads irrigation data from Aqualink to IrrigWeb; and 2) Downlink, which automatically downloads irrigation schedules from IrrigWeb and apply them to Aqualink.
